## Getting Started

### Run Locally

You need Node.js 24, pnpm 9.15.9, and an [Agora project](https://console.agora.io/) with Conversational AI enabled.

**1. Install and configure**

Clone or download this repository, then open a terminal in its directory.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

if [ ! -f .env.local ]; then
  cp env.local.example .env.local
fi
```

Create or select a project in [Agora Console](https://console.agora.io/). Open **Manage credentials** and copy its **App ID** and **Primary certificate** into `.env.local` ([instructions](https://docs.agora.io/en/introduction/console-setup)):

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID=your_agora_app_id
NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=your_agora_app_certificate
```

You don’t need separate API keys for the default speech and language models. Put the App Certificate in `.env.local` and never expose it in browser code.

See [env.local.example](env.local.example) for the configuration template.

**2. Start the app**

```bash
pnpm run doctor
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), choose **Start customer support**, and allow microphone access. Ask the assistant to summarize the conversation if needed, then click the hang-up button (**End session**).

### Deploy to Vercel

[![Import into Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAgoraIO-Community%2Fagora-customer-support-assistant-demo&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID%2CNEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE&envDescription=Agora%20App%20ID%20and%20App%20Certificate%20from%20Agora%20Console.%20Enable%20Conversational%20AI%20for%20the%20project.&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.agora.io%2Fen%2Fintroduction%2Fconsole-setup&project-name=agora-customer-support-assistant-demo&repository-name=agora-customer-support-assistant-demo)

1. Click the button to clone this repository into your Git account and import it into Vercel.
2. Select **Next.js** and Node.js 24.
3. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID` and `NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` under **Environment Variables**, then deploy.

## How It Works

1. **Start a conversation:** Choose **Start customer support** and allow microphone access.
2. **Describe the issue:** Explain the product or service problem and what you have already tried.
3. **Work through it:** Discuss one useful check or next step at a time.
4. **Take a recap:** Ask for a summary to use when contacting the seller or support team.

### Architecture

```

Next.js issues browser tokens and supplies the scenario instructions when starting the Agora Agent. Conversation behavior is prompt-driven; no live business system is connected. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.

## FAQ

### Do I need to connect a help desk to try this demo?

No. You can try the demo with your Agora project and the bundled support guidance.

### What should I tell the assistant?

Name the product or service, describe the problem, and mention what you have already tried. For a return or delivery question, share the relevant message or policy rather than an account identifier. Try “My headphones will not connect. I already tried restarting them.”

### Why does it ask me to check with the seller?

The assistant has no access to your order or the seller’s product manuals and policies. It can help explain details you provide and prepare the question to ask, but it cannot verify eligibility or issue a refund.

### Why can’t I start a voice session?

Check browser microphone permission, the selected input device, and your Agora App ID, App Certificate, and Conversational AI access. Use localhost or HTTPS. Run `pnpm run doctor` for local configuration checks, then use the page’s error message to guide a retry.

### Can I save a copy of the conversation?

Yes. Open Inspector and select **Export session evidence** to download the current or latest call as JSON. Export it before starting another call or refreshing the page.

### How do I make this demo more realistic?

Connect your own knowledge base and business services using [RAG](https://docs.agora.io/en/ai/build/custom-model-integration/custom-llm), [tool calling](https://docs.agora.io/en/ai/build/tools/custom-tools), or [MCP](https://docs.agora.io/en/ai/build/tools/mcp-tools). When adding tools, set `advancedFeatures.enable_tools` to `true` in [Agent setup](app/api/invite-agent/route.ts).

### How do I adapt this demo to my own use case?

Customize the agent’s prompt, business tools, and interface for your scenario.
